# stable-diffusion-prompts

This is a companion site to https://publicprompts.art/ that is available at https://cgoldammer.github.io/stable-diffusion-prompts/. 
Our goal is to share good prompts as open source. By design, all prompts in here are available 
as raw data in the [`_data`](./_data) folder. We encourage participation and will gladly merge PRs if 
they fit in the existing structure.
