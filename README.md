# stable-diffusion-prompts

This is a companion site to https://publicprompts.art/. 
Our goal is to share good prompts as open source. By design, all prompts in here are available 
as raw data in the `_data` folder. We encourage participation and will gladly merge PRs if 
they fit in the existing structure.
